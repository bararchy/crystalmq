This application is very similar to NSQ. You will need three components.

1) A Message Router, running with either debug set to true or false
	
	crystal router.cr false
	
2) A Message Consumer, with a topic and channel set
	
	crystal tools/consumer.cr my_topic my_channel
	
3) A Message Producer, with a topic and message
	
	crystal tools/producer.cr my_topic "Hello World"
	
If you would like to run the benchmarks, feel free to use tools/meth

	./meth --consumer # Will benchmark received messags (used in conjuction with producer)
	./meth --producer # Will benchmark sent messages (used in conjunction with consumer)
	./meth --latency  # Will benchmark request latency
